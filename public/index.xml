      <description>Analysis and Comparison of Partisan Lean of US Representatives and House LegislationAnkur Bhagwath, EID asb3477MW 1-230IntroductionThe datasets I have chosen contain data about all 435 members of the current 116th House of Representatives (elected 2018). The partisan leans of each of these representatives was determined through their DW-Nominate score, an objective metric developed by political scientists at UCLA. This places all representatives on a scale from -1 to 1, with more negative scores being more liberal and more positive scores being more conservative.</description>
