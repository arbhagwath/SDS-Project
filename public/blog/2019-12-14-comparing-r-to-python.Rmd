Hello! Today, we'll be looking at the differences in R and Python to do simple statistical tasks. 
At first, it might seem to be a little scary:

But it's really not! Just like a raccoon at night, what appears to be scary is actually quite docile.
First, we want to bring in the Reticulate package, to convert between R and Python: among other packages.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(dplyr)
```
We'll use this in a bit. First off, Python has the ability to do basic functions more easily, and with pipes:
```{r}
use_python("C://Users/arbha/Anaconda3/python.exe")
a <- 1:10
fivenum(a)
faithful <- read.csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/faithful.csv")
mean(faithful$waiting)
faithful %>% filter(waiting < median(waiting)) %>% summarise(m = mean(waiting))

```
In Python, it's a bit more complicated:
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
print(np.mean(r.a))
```

```{python}
r.faithful[r.faithful.waiting < np.median(r.faithful.waiting)].waiting.mean()
```
It's a bit less intuitive with the setup, but the results are much the same. Notice that while using reticulate, we can access items from R in Python. We can do the reverse in R, if we import the same dataset in python:
```{python}
faith2 = r.faithful
```
And in R:
```{r}
py$faith2 %>% filter(waiting < median(waiting)) %>% summarise(m = mean(waiting))
```
And we get the same result!
There are other nice things that can be done primarily using packages in python, for example, the findall function to find all 3 digit numbers in the list below:
```{python}
import re
str1 = "23,26,454,17,99,851,63,124,90,42,456,7,984"
re.findall(r'\d+\d+\d',str1)


```
Another thing you may find Python more convenient for is the use of for loops. These can be used in making scoring algorithms to determine sequence matching. For example, a Smith-Waterman algorithm is shown below (courtesy of Dr. Woodward):
```{python}
match_score = 2
mismatch_score = -1
gap_penalty = 0

seq1 = "TAGATA"
seq2 = "AAGGATA"

def sw_fun(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty=-1, match_score=1, mismatch_score=-1):
    m=len(seq1) #length of horizontal sequence
    n=len(seq2) #length of vertical sequence
    score=np.empty(shape=[n+1,m+1]) #array to hold scores
   
    for j in range(0, m + 1): 
        score[0][j] = gap_penalty * j
    for i in range(0, n + 1): 
        score[i][0] = gap_penalty * i
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1): 
        for j in range(1, m + 1):
            insert = max(score[i - 1][j] + gap_penalty, 0)
            delete = max(score[i][j - 1] + gap_penalty, 0) 
            match = max(score[i - 1][j - 1] + match_score if seq1[j-1]==seq2[i-1] else score[i-1][j-1]+ mismatch_score, 0)
            score[i][j] = max(match, delete, insert)
            
    for j in range(0, m + 1): 
        score[0][j] = max(gap_penalty * j, 0)
    for i in range(0, n + 1): 
        score[i][0] = max(gap_penalty * i, 0)
    return score

sw_fun(seq1,seq2,gap_penalty,match_score,mismatch_score)
```

In conclusion, R may be designed specially for statistical programming, but a lot of interesting stuff can be done with Python as well!
